            <h2>About the Programme</h2>

            <p>
                The university teaches smart civil engineering practices, and it has completely revised its content by
                making 3D modelling with CAD tools, Rivet, and other software. Well-versed in the latest Survey Tools
                and Equipment like Total Station, DGPS and GPR, students learn satellite and aerial based surveying that
                includes LiDAR survey as well as satellite image processing. The construction management includes
                project management, and it is aligned with NSQF Level-6 curriculum for the profession. Students get to
                design and plan construction projects, and they are familiarised with Smart City Planning, BIM modelling
                up to LoD 5. They also learn solid and sewage treatment as part of environmental engineering, and modern
                facade making using CATIA xGenerative Design app of Dassault Syst√©mes

                    Course Overview</span> With this specialization, students learn about smart cities within the context of urban infrastructure management. The introduction of smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has resulted in numerous challenges and opportunities for contemporary cities and will continue to do so. Equipped with Dassault tools, students are enabled to build digitaltwins of cities/towns using OSM and drone based arial survey maps. appreciating the challenges of optimising smart city planning in legacy environments, they also learn to simulate shading analysis, flood analysis, seismic analysis on 3D models. With the opportunity to work on challenging real-time projects, using point cloud data and converting it into 3D LOD 3 maps, students have excelled in remodelling and simulation of Amravati City in Andhra Pradesh and Jaipur Smart City. <br><br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Duration</span>- Four

                    Course Overview</span> Having access to the latest survey equipment like Total Station, DGPS and GPR, students learn satellite and aerial based surveying, which includes LiDAR survey as well as satellite image processing. In construction, management students get to plan, optimize, and implement a construction project. Learning various QC procedures in large infrastructure projects with a mandatory internship in such construction sites, students get to design multi-storied structures, bridges, stadiums and other such large infrastructure projects using advanced software tools. Students are familiarised with new state-of-the-art construction materials (including composites), and they also learn to waterproof and repair damaged concrete structures using specialty building chemicals. </p>
