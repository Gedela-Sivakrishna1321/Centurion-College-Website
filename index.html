                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Lifelong learning is an extension of classrooms, books and theories. The
                    DNA of Centurion is to offer ramps and ladders for multiple entry and exit by adopting and adapting
                    National Credit Framework.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The appropriate balance of knowledge and skills is the key to making a
                    real difference. Centurion learning labs are real-time market linked production hubs for immersive
                    and competency linked education deliveries</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The university and our students must transform societies and communities
                    within which it exists – change begins with us and from within. The Centurion survives and thrives
                    on disruptions and relevant innovations to co-create a holistic learning ecosystem.</p>

        <p>   The journey of Centurion University of Technology and Management (CUTM) began in the year 2005 by a group of
            ambitious academics with aspirations to provide high quality education both nationally and internationally.
            The first step in this direction was to take over an ailing engineering Institute, the Jagannath Institute
            for Technology and Management (JITM) in one of the most challenging tribal districts of Odisha and one which
            was considered to be a left-wing extremist affected area. Subsequently, JITM was transformed into Centurion
            University of Technology and Management in August 2010, through an act of Odisha Legislative Assembly. It
            became the First Multi-Sector State Private University in Odisha</p>

      

        <p>    The core objective of CUTM is ‘shaping lives and empower communities’, and creating wealth and livelihood
            opportunities at the bottom of the pyramid. The objective is achieved through education and training,
            financial services and other projects in rural communities, particularly in southern Odisha and northern
            coastal Andhra Pradesh. CUTM has strong environmental as well as social values. The University leads a
            network of educational institutions delivering primary, secondary, tertiary and vocational education and
            training. CUTM evolved from the Jagannath Institute of Technology and Management (JITM) and Centurion School
            of Rural Enterprise Management (CSREM) at Parlakhemundi, and the Centurion Institute of Technology (CIT) at
            Jatni, Bhubaneswar</p>
        

        <p>          The Centurion Group of Institutions have more than 200 acres of campus area and 8,00,000 sq ft of built-up
            area across nine locations in Odisha (Jatni, Paralakhemundi, Koraput, Rayagada, Bolangir and Balasore) and
            Andhra Pradesh (Vishakhapatnam, Hyderabed, Kanchili and Pathpatanam). It has capacity for fully residential
            programs with separate dormitory facilities for men and women for over 900 trainees at any point of time or
            6000-7000 youth per year. It has 200+ networked computers with round-the-clock Broadband 1 GB lease line
            internet connectivity and Language Lab for soft skill development of students. It has 5 NCVT Affiliated ITCs
            offering Fitter, Electrician, Welder, Computer Operator, Hardware & Networking, Diesel Mechanic and MMV
            trades. CUTM has NSDC Funded workshops equipped with high end machine tools including CNC Lathe, CNC
            Milling, etc. In addition, the University is fully equipped mechanical engineering lab, civil engineering
            electrical engineering lab, electronics and communication engineering lab, physics and chemistry lab and
            workshops for fitter and welder. Its training cum production facility is equipped with CAD/CAM lab.
