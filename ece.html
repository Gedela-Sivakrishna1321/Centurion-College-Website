            <h2>About the Programme</h2>

            <p>
                The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering strives for excellence in teaching, research, and professional services, to achieve eminence in selected niche areas viz. Embedded Systems and IoT, Chip Design using VLSI and Communication Systems. In collaboration with industry partners such as Tessolve Semiconductor, Dassault Syst√©mes, Sunmoksha Power and Electronics Center of Excellence (Bhubaneswar), it gives students a plethora of opportunities to work on exciting projects based on real-time applications. Equipped with the latest hardware like ARM Cortex processors, FPGA boards, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino boards, students also get to work onvprocessor design as well as System on Chip (SoC) design and testing. The university is participating in the Chromite SoC project of the indigenous Shakti Processor, and its faculty are also working on Bio Medical instrumentation as well as digital manufacturing and chip making with Marquee Semiconductors, as well as ECU for e-vehicles. With a focus on product development using Fab Lab technologies, the required labs and industry partnerships exist to design, fabricate, and test a board level or PCB level solution as a precursor to chip development. In communication, students get to work on HFSS tools for antenna design and BTS installation and maintenance. </p>

                Course Overview </span>Chip Fabrication course is a blended learning program, which includes both online theory sessions along with lab practicals, offline projects, and internship programs. It is carefully designed, based on the industry requirements, and it trains electronics engineers extensively on both the design and verification methodologies like RTL design and UVM methodologies. With this course, students become proficient in Cadence tools for VLSI design and verification, and get to develop applications using Chromite SoC. They also get to work with FPGA board, and learn the fundamentals of SoC design and fabrication. Understanding of the blocks in SoC design, gives students the confidence to think of executing Chip Design. The university works with companies like Tessolve and Marquee Semiconductors; and aims to produce industry-ready manpower for the semi-conductor industry in India.
