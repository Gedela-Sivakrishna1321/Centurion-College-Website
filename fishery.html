            <h2>About the Programme</h2>

            <p>
                The school supports students in developing their competency in Water Quality Management, Fish Health Management, Feed Management, Aquatic Environmental Management, and Fish Processing Technology, through skill-based learning. It has dedicated units such as 21 fishponds, fish feed mill, Biofloc unit, ornamental unit, aquaponic unit, Chinese circular hatcheries, fish processing unit, RAS system and dedicated laboratories. Students get hands-on practices for navigating trawlers, net webbing and repairing, preparation of value-added fish products, through various academic partners such as ICAR-CIFA, ICAR-CIWA, ICAR-CMFRI, NIPHATT, ICAR-CIFT, Growel Feeds, Tata Rallies, and many other fisheries institutes and companies. The school is also committed to use IoTs for developing smart intensive aquaculture for commercial production of fishes in earthen and RAS Units. In order to develop entrepreneurial skills among its peers, it has also developed two domain courses (Intensive Aquaculture and Fish Processing Technology) where students practice the methodologies adopted in aqua/processing industries

                    Course Overviewbr   <br> </span>This domain empowers students to understand novel technologies applied in processing for the product development of dry fish, salted and smoked fish, frozen fillets, mince-based products like surimi, ham and sausage, etc. Students gain knowledge about fish by-product valorization into value-added products such as silage, fish protein hydrolysate, chitin, chitosan and collagen. Besides value added fish products, the domain provides hands-on experience on quality assessment of fish and fishery products using microbiological techniques like TPC, identification of fish spoilage organisms (S. aureus, E. coli, C. botulinum, etc), and various other biochemical techniques â€“ Proximate composition, TMA, TVB-N, TBARS and PV. Students also experience educational visits to leading fish processing and training institutes like ICAR-CIFT and NIFPHATT. This domain makes students technically skilled and ready for career placements, while also helping them develop entrepreneur skills
