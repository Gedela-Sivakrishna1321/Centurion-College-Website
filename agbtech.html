            <h2>About the Programme</h2>

            <p>
                Earning a bachelorâ€™s degree in Agricultural Engineering opens the scope for students to work in various areas including Farm Machinery, Soil and Water Conservation, Food Processing, Dairy Technology, Smart Agriculture, and so on. Students learn the design and operation of different farm machineries and implements like plough, seed drill, harvester, thresher, etc. The application of engineering in solving water management issues using advanced tools like ArcGIS, SWAT, and HEC-RAS, is taught. Students gain insight into the engineering aspects of food equipment design and processing, while getting hands-on experience in different food processing/preservation methods like freeze-drying, extraction, and value-added product development. It is mandatory for students to undergo training in smart agriculture and other specialized domains. They also get to do internships in various training institutes such as CFMTTI, CIPHET, IISWC, etc </div>

                    Course Overview <br> </span>This course includes the study of farm machinery design and the application of sensors and actuators. Students learn 3D modelling of machine components and their simulation using Dassault tools like CATIA and SOLIDWORKS. They also get the technical know-how needed for drone piloting and operating different agricultural machines such as tractor-mounted implements and combine harvester. Students have done many projects on creating smart seed planter, smart intra-row weeder, and smart chemical sprayer, while the development of 60 KW electric tractor has already started. In this course, students also get opportunities to do internship in the R&D development of tractor companies like ESCORTS and SONALIKA<br><br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Duration</span>- Four

                    Course Overview <br> </span>With this course, students learn various food processing/preservation methods such as hot air drying, freeze-drying, extraction of essential oils, pickling, jam, jelly, sauce and candy preparation, wine preparation, etc. They also get to develop and assemble food processing equipment based on modern technologies such as Microwave Assisted Extraction, IR dryer, etc. Learning to use equipment for determining the food composition, they get the know-how to develop innovative food products viz. cup-cake from ragi, starch free potato residue, vitamin and fibre enriched curd, and so on. Equipped with various analytical equipment including HPLC for food product characterization, students are enabled to make edible film from potato starch and are working to utilize other agro wastes for biodegradable packaging to address environmental issues. With internship programs in bakery units, mini dairy units and SC-CO2 extraction units, students gain skills and confidence of working in large production plants<br><br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Duration</span>- Four
