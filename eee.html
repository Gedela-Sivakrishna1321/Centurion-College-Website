                    Course Overview</span> Factories of the future require intelligent manufacturing systems with automated controls and robotic manufacturing processes, and a high amount of digitization of all production processes. As PLCs and robotics play a big role in such factories, the university trains its students with the help of FESTO, Siemens and Dassault Syst√©mes. Students get to use programming with Siemens/ ABB/ FANUC controllers and work on process automation. Getting to practice on RSLinx Software of Rockwell Automation (USA), and HMI and two drives, students get the know-how to build practical applications, which include Boom Barriers, Liquid Dispensers, and simulation of automated production processes using FESTO industry lab. <br><br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Duration</span>- Four
